Please Notice:
-It's well-advised to run it on an Android phone, instead of the emulator. (please notice that the minSdkVersion is 21, please update if necessary)
  
-If more than 1 person has the application opened, the current user location shown on the minimap will keep changing

-Please enable location and camera permissions to use the application (It will show "Camera not found" if it cannot find the camera)
