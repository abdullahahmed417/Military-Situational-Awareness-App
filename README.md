The completion of this assignment is inseparable from the sharing of enthusiastic and helpful developers on Github and StackOverflow. 
Since we have never learned AR scenes before (applying for location permissions, applying for camera permissions, displaying the algorithm of the marker in AR, and the related code of the sensor), 
mini-map (adding tags to the mini-map), connect to firebase and to obtain data from it, we conducted a lot of research and self-study.


Please Notice:
-It's well-advised to run it on an Android phone, instead of the emulator. (please notice that the minSdkVersion is 21, please update if necessary)
 The user may get an error message when running on the emulator, but this won't have an effect on the main functions. 
  
-If more than 1 person has the application opened, the current user location shown on the minimap will keep changing

-Please enable location and camera permissions to use the application (It will show "Camera not found" if it cannot find the camera)


Reference list:
We have done a lot of study and research on Dnt Nguten's code in the AR function and made a lot of modifications and improvements, and solved multiple bugs:
